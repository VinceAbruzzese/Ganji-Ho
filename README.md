The Ganji-Ho project was developed during an Artificial Intelligence class (COMP 472) at concordia university.
This program uses heuristic algorithms to play the game of Ganji-Ho versus a human player. The idea of the game is
to have two players: one that enters values vertically and another who enters values horizontally. One by one 
each player gets a turn and must place their choice in the best possible place so that the opponent has less moves
to make. The player with no more moves left loses. Below is a sample:
